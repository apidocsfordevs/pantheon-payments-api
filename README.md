# pantheon-payments-api

Dummy repository representing the Payments microservice of the Pantheon API (from [API Documentation for Developers](https://apidocsfordevs.com)).

## Setup
There's no code in here, so nothing to set up, really.

## Documentation
The documentation for all our APIs is hosted at http://pantheon-docs.vercel.app. The reference documentation for this API is pulled from the `openapi.yaml` file in the root of this repository at build time (by Travis CI). Remember to update the OpenAPI file after making any changes to the API.
